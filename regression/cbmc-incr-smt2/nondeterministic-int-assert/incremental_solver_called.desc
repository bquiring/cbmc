Passing problem to incremental SMT2 solving via "z3"
^EXIT=(0|127|134|137)$

Test that running cbmc with the `--incremental-smt2-solver` argument causes the
incremental smt2 solving to be used. Note that at the time of adding this test,
an invariant violation is expected due to the unimplemented solving.
