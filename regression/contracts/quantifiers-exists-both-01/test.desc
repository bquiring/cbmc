The purpose of this test is to ensure that we can safely use __CPROVER_exists
in a negative context (which is currently not always the case). By using the
--enforce-all-contracts flag, this test assumes the statement in 
__CPROVER_requires, then asserts the same statement (in __CPROVER_ensures),
thus, verification should be successful.
