The purpose of this test is to ensure that we can safely use __CPROVER_forall
in a negative context (which is currently not always the case). By using the
--enforce-all-contracts flag, this test assumes the statement in
__CPROVER_requires, then asserts the same statement (in __CPROVER_ensures), 
thus, verification should be successful.

Known bug:
The current implementation cannot handle a structure such as
__CPROVER_assume(__CPROVER_forall(int i; pred(i))), where i is
not explicitly bounded to a predefined range (i.e. if at least
one of its bound is only declared and not defined).
