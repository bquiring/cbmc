This confirms the accuracy of the postconditions of f1, f2_out and f2_in.

Test should fail:
The postcondition of f2 is incorrect, considering the recursion particularity. 

Recursion:
The base case for the recursive call to f2 provides different behavior than the general case (given the pre-conditions).

Known bug:
This test requires the "--unwind 20 --unwinding-assertions" flag for the cbmc call in "chain.sh", which is currently not handled.
