This test fails even without the fix proposed in the commit, so it should be improved.
It is expected to fail because the proposed invariant isn't strong enough to help prove
termination using the specified variant.

The test highlights a case where a C loop guard is compiled to multiple GOTO instructions.
Therefore the loop_head pointer needs to be advanced multiple times to get to the loop body,
where the initial value of the loop variant (/ ranking function) must be recorded.

The proposed fix advances the pointer until the source_location differs from the original
loop_head's source_location. However, this might still not work if the loop guard in the
original C code was split across multiple lines in the first place.
