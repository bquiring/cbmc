The purpose of this test is to ensure that we can safely use __CPROVER_exists
in __CPROVER_ensures clauses. By using the --enforce-all-contracts flag, 
goto-instrument will transform the __CPROVER_ensures clauses into an
assertion and the verification remains sound when using __CPROVER_exists.

Known Bug:
We expect verification to fail because arr[i] is always equal to 0 for
[0 <= i < 10]. In fact, we expect the (0 <= i && i < 10) statement to act as a
range for i. However, in the current implementation of quantifier handling,
the (0 <= i && i < 10) statement is not interpreted as an explicit range, but
instead, as part of a logic formula, which causes verification to succeed.
