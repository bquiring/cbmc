This confirms the accuracy of the preconditions of f2_in (called from f2_out) and of the postconditions of f1 and of f2_out.

Recursion
(1) This test checks the mutualy recursive f2_out and f2-in functions by enforcing f2_out and replacing the internal f2_in call with its contract.
(2) This test does not require unwinding.
(3) The base case for the recursive call to f2 provides the same behavior as the common case (given the pre-conditions).

Known bug:
Enforce flag not handled correctly for function calls within functions.
This bug is fixed in PR #5538.
