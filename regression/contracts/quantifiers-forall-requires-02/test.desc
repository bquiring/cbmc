The purpose of this test is to ensure that we can safely use __CPROVER_forall
in __CPROVER_requires clauses. By using the --replace-all-calls-with-contracts
flag, goto-instrument will transform the __CPROVER_requires clauses into an
assertion and the verification remains sound when using __CPROVER_forall.
