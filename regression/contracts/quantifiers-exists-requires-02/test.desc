^VERIFICATION FAILED$

The purpose of this test is to ensure that we can safely use __CPROVER_exists
in __CPROVER_requires clauses. By using the --replace-all-calls-with-contracts
flag, goto-instrument will transform the __CPROVER_requires clauses into an
assertion and the verification remains sound when using __CPROVER_exists.

Known Bug:
We expect verification to fail because arr[i] is never equal to 1 for
[0 <= i < 10]. In fact, we expect the (0 <= i && i < 10) statement to act as a
range for i. However, in the current implementation of quantifier handling,
the (0 <= i && i < 10) statement is not interpreted as an explicit range, but
instead, as part of a logic formula, which causes verification to succeed.
