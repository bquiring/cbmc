For uninitialised pointers, CBMC chooses a nondeterministic value (though no memory
is allocated). Since the offset of pointers is signed, negative offsets should be
able to be chosen (along with positive ones) non-deterministically.
`__CPROVER_POINTER_OFFSET` is the CBMC primitive that gets the pointer offset
from the base address of the object. This test guards this, and especially
against the case where we could only observe some cases where offsets were only
positive (in some CI configurations, for instance).
